Redux has 3 core concepts 
  * Action
  * Reducers
  * Store


Action -> it is a object.
        It tells what we want to change the state.

Reducers -> it is function (pure function), which contains initial and
            previous state and how to change the state based on your Action

Store -> It is a place where all Reducers and state are stored
